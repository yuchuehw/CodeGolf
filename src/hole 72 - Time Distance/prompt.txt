Transform a time distance given as a number of seconds to a human-friendly string representation.

    Zero represents the current moment, to be printed as now.
    Positive values represent the future, to be printed with the in prefix.
    Negative values represent the past, to be printed with the ago suffix.

The largest possible unit of time among a second, a minute (60 seconds), an hour (60 minutes), a day (24 hours), a week (7 days), a month (30 days) and a year (365 days) is always chosen and the quantity is always rounded towards zero.

The correct singular/plural of each unit must be used. If the quantity is 1, print a month and an hour rather than 1 month and 1 hour.
