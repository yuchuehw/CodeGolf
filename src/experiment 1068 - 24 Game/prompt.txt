The 24 game is an arithmetical puzzle in which the objective is to find a way to combine four integers using only basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ร, รท) to get a result of 24. Each integer must be used exactly once.

The original version of 24 is played with integers from 1 to 10. Print all solvable quadruples of integers. The integers of each quadruple should be printed in non-decreasing order.

Keep in mind that some solutions involve fractions. For example, the only solution to 1 3 4 6 is 6/(1-3/4).
