Print the first 100 rows in the Rule 110 cellular automaton starting from an initial single living cell.

Each new row in the life of the automaton should be a new line, and the rules for whether a cell is alive or dead depends on whether it was alive on the previous iteration, as well as the state of the two neighbouring cells.

The rules which dictate whether a cell is alive or dead in the next iteration are as follows:
111	0
110	1
101	1
100	0
011	1
010	1
001	1
000	0

where 1 is alive, 0 is dead, and the middle digit represents the previous state of the current cell.

The first 10 rows are shown here:

         █
        ██
       ███
      ██ █
     █████
    ██   █
   ███  ██
  ██ █ ███
 ███████ █
██     ███
