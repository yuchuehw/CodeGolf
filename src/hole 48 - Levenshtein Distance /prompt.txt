The Levenshtein distance is the minimum number of single character edits that are needed to transform one word into another. The available edits are deletion, insertion, or substitution of a single character.

For example the Levenshtein distance between “shine” and “train” is 4:

    shine → shin (deletion of 'e')
    shin → tshin (insertion of 't')
    tshin → trhin (substitution of 's' for 'r')
    trhin → train (substitution of 'h' for 'a')

For each pair of words per argument, print the Levenshtein distance on its own line.
