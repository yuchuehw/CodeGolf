Brainfuck is a minimalistic esoteric programming language created by Urban MÃ¼ller in 1993.

Assuming an infinitely large array, the entire brainfuck alphabet matches the following pseudocode:
>	ptr++
<	ptr--
+	array[ptr]++
-	array[ptr]--
.	print(chr(array[ptr]))
[	while(array[ptr]){
]	}

Write a program that will receive various brainfuck programs as arguments and execute each program in turn.
